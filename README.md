Free to use, open source lithophane maker built using python. The end goal is to convert an image to grayscale, and using the intensity of each pixel to find the height. Then using these values to create a mesh with the numpy-stl library which create's an stl file for 3D printing. Right now the only implementation I am considering is a flat lithophane.
